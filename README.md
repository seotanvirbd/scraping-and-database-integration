# Cryptocurrency Data Scraper 🚀

This project is all about diving into the world of cryptocurrencies! 💰

## Overview

Using Python, I developed a script that leverages the power of Playwright 🎭 to scrape real-time data from CoinMarketCap 🌐. The script navigates the webpage, scrolls to load data, and extracts key details about each cryptocurrency, such as its ID, name, symbol, price, market cap, and 24-hour volume 📊.

## Data Storage

The data is then structured and stored in a PostgreSQL database 🗃️ using psycopg2, making it easy to analyze and gain insights from.

## Conclusion

This project was a fantastic opportunity to combine web scraping and database management, and I'm excited about the potential applications in data analysis and beyond! 📈🚀
